      <p>Requests to transfer a contract to another provider need to be checked by an authorised reviewer before they are actioned.</p>

      <p>
        A reviewer is usually someone in your commissioning organisation. You can choose to notify a specific reviewer if you wish.

    <p>
        You can also attach any supporting documentation to help the reviewer.
